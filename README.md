# OCD-Patients

## Overview
The **OCD-Patients** repository is designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of healthcare data related to patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights for stakeholders, including healthcare providers and researchers, by leveraging advanced business intelligence tools and methods.

## Tools and Technologies

### 1. MySQL
- **Purpose**: To store, manage, and query patient data efficiently.
- **Key Use Cases**:
  - Retrieving data related to patient demographics, symptoms, and treatment outcomes.
  - Performing complex queries to identify trends and anomalies.

### 2. Power BI
- **Purpose**: To create visually appealing and interactive dashboards for stakeholders.
- **Key Use Cases**:
  - Developing trend analysis dashboards to monitor patient improvement over time.
  - Visualizing geographic distribution of patients for regional insights.

### 3. Excel
- **Purpose**: For quick analysis and visualization of smaller datasets.
- **Key Use Cases**:
  - Creating pivot tables and charts for ad-hoc reporting.
  - Conducting scenario analysis and sharing results in a portable format.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
  - **Source Data Identification**: Extract OCD-related data from relevant datasets or databases.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Use Excel to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
  - **Data Import**: Transfer the cleaned data into MySQL for structured storage and querying.

### 2. Database Design and Management

- **Schema Design**: Create normalized tables in MySQL to represent the data entities and their relationships.
- **Data Ingestion**: Import cleaned datasets into the MySQL database using tools like LOAD DATA INFILE or MySQL Workbench.
- **Query Optimization**: Write and optimize SQL queries to efficiently extract insights.

### 3. Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use SQL and Excel to summarize and explore the data for trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Data Transformation**: Prepare data subsets and aggregate metrics as required for visualization.

### 4. Visualization and Reporting

- **Power BI Dashboard Development**: Connect Power BI to the MySQL database for live data integration. Design interactive dashboards to visualize OCD patient trends, statistics, and other relevant metrics.
- **Report Automation**: Set up scheduled refreshes in Power BI for updated data representation.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Validate SQL queries and Power BI reports for accuracy.
- Cross-check dashboard insights against source data for consistency.

### 6. Documentation and Deployment
- Document workflows, SQL queries, and Power BI design considerations.
- Share dashboards and reports with stakeholders via Power BI Service or other platforms.
